📁 Project File Structure Explanation
🔹 Root Directory: XAI-Intrusion-Detection/

This is the main project directory that contains all backend logic, frontend interface, documentation, and configuration files.

🧠 backend/

This folder contains all core machine learning, detection, explainability, and API logic of the intrusion detection system.

📄 app.py

Purpose: Backend API entry point.

Handles requests from the frontend

Accepts network traffic data

Calls prediction, risk scoring, and explainability modules

Sends results (prediction, risk score, explanations) back to the dashboard

📌 Role: Integrates all backend components into a single service.

📄 config.py

Purpose: Central configuration file.

Stores file paths (dataset, model)

Defines constants like thresholds and parameters

Helps avoid hardcoded values

📌 Role: Improves maintainability and scalability.

📄 requirements.txt

Purpose: Dependency management.

Lists all Python libraries used (scikit-learn, SHAP, FastAPI/Flask, pandas, numpy, etc.)

Ensures reproducible environment setup

📌 Role: Makes the project easy to install and run.

📊 backend/data/

Stores datasets used by the system.

📁 raw/

Contains: KDDTrain+.txt, KDDTest+.txt

Original, unprocessed NSL-KDD dataset

Used as input for preprocessing

📌 Role: Preserves original data for reference and reproducibility.

📁 processed/

Contains: processed_data.csv

Cleaned and encoded version of dataset

Used directly for training and testing

📌 Role: Speeds up training and prediction.

⚙️ backend/preprocessing/
📄 preprocess.py

Purpose: Data preparation module.

Handles missing values

Encodes categorical features

Normalizes numerical features

Splits dataset into training and testing sets

📌 Role: Ensures clean and ML-ready data.

🤖 backend/model/

Contains all machine learning–related logic.

📄 train_model.py

Purpose: Model training module.

Trains Random Forest classifier on processed data

Evaluates initial performance

Saves trained model as .pkl

📌 Role: Builds the intrusion detection intelligence.

📄 predict.py

Purpose: Prediction module.

Loads trained model

Predicts whether traffic is normal or an attack

Outputs probability scores

📌 Role: Performs real-time or batch intrusion detection.

📄 risk_score.py

Purpose: Threat scoring module.

Converts prediction probability into a 0–100 risk score

Categorizes threat as Low, Medium, or High

📌 Role: Transforms ML output into actionable security insight.

🔍 backend/explainability/
📄 shap_explainer.py

Purpose: Explainable AI module.

Uses SHAP TreeExplainer for Random Forest

Identifies top features influencing each prediction

Generates human-readable explanations

📌 Role: Adds transparency and trust to the IDS.

💾 backend/saved_models/
📄 rf_model.pkl

Purpose: Stored trained model.

Saved Random Forest classifier

Loaded during prediction phase

📌 Role: Separates training and inference stages.

🛠️ backend/utils/
📄 helpers.py

Purpose: Utility functions.

Common reusable functions

Logging, formatting, helper operations

📌 Role: Keeps code clean and modular.

🖥️ frontend/

Contains the user interface for the IDS dashboard.

📄 index.html

Purpose: Dashboard structure.

Displays alerts, risk scores, explanations

Acts as main UI page

📌 Role: User interaction layer.

📁 css/
📄 styles.css

Purpose: Styling file.

Controls layout, colors, and responsiveness

Improves readability and usability

📌 Role: Enhances user experience.

📁 js/
📄 dashboard.js

Purpose: Frontend logic.

Sends data to backend API

Receives prediction results

Dynamically updates dashboard content

📌 Role: Connects UI with backend intelligence.

📚 docs/

Contains documentation and academic materials.

📄 architecture.png

Purpose: System architecture diagram.

Visual representation of data flow

Used in report and presentations

📄 project_report.pdf

Purpose: Final academic report.

Problem statement

Methodology

Results and analysis

Conclusion and future work

📄 research_notes.md

Purpose: Research reference file.

Notes on related work

Ideas for novelty

Future enhancements

📄 README.md

Purpose: Project overview.

Explains how to install, run, and use the project

Describes features and structure

📌 Role: First point of contact for users and evaluators.

🚫 .gitignore

Purpose: Version control hygiene.

Prevents committing datasets, models, and temp files

Keeps repository clean
