🔍 DETAILED EXPLANATION (FILE BY FILE)
🔹 backend/

This is the brain of the system — ML models, explanations, APIs, and logic live here.

app.py

Role: Main backend entry point

What it does:

Starts the FastAPI / Flask server

Accepts incoming traffic data (JSON / CSV)

Calls:

predict.py → classification

risk_score.py → severity

shap_explainer.py → feature importance

explanation_engine.py → human-readable explanation

Sends structured output to frontend

👉 Examiner-friendly line:

“This file integrates detection, explainability, and risk scoring into a single API.”

config.py

Role: Central configuration file

Contains:

Dataset paths

Model paths

Feature lists

Thresholds (risk score, anomaly score)

Why important:

Avoids hardcoding

Makes deployment easier (AWS-ready)

requirements.txt

Role: Dependency management

Lists:

scikit-learn

pandas

numpy

shap

fastapi / flask

joblib

Used during:

pip install -r requirements.txt

🔹 data/
data/raw/

Role: Original untouched datasets

KDDTrain+.txt

KDDTest+.txt

Why untouched?

Research reproducibility

Prevents data leakage

Matches academic standards

data/processed/

Role: Machine-learning ready data

processed_data.csv

Encoded

Normalized

Label-cleaned

Ready for training

⚠️ Not pushed to GitHub (size + best practice)

🔹 preprocessing/
preprocess.py

Role: Data transformation pipeline

What it does:

Loads raw NSL-KDD data

Encodes categorical features

Normalizes numerical values

Converts labels → normal / attack

Saves processed CSV

This explains why your data looked like:

-0.11248, 2.23595, -0.71982, ...


👉 That’s standardized numerical ML input, not corruption.

🔹 model/
train_model.py

Role: Train Random Forest classifier

What it does:

Loads processed data

Trains Random Forest

Evaluates accuracy

Saves rf_model.pkl

Why Random Forest?

High accuracy

Interpretable with SHAP

Handles tabular data well

predict.py

Role: Inference engine

What it outputs:

prediction: Normal / Attack

probability: Confidence of being an attack

Important clarification:

✅ Probability = likelihood that traffic belongs to attack class

risk_score.py

Role: Threat severity estimation

Converts probability into:

0–30   → Low risk
31–70  → Medium risk
71–100 → High risk


This helps SOC teams prioritize alerts.

🔹 anomaly_detection/
isolation_forest.py

Role: Zero-day / unknown attack detection

What it does:

Trains Isolation Forest on normal traffic

Flags anomalous behavior

Works even when attack type is unseen

This is how you handle zero-day attacks without labels.

🔹 explainability/
shap_explainer.py

Role: Model transparency

Uses SHAP to:

Identify top contributing features

Explain why a sample was classified as attack

Output:

Top features: src_bytes, srv_serror_rate, same_srv_rate

explanation_engine.py ⭐ (Your innovation)

Role: Converts SHAP output into sentences

Example logic:

IF srv_serror_rate high AND same_srv_rate low
→ DoS-like behavior


Final explanation:

“The traffic was classified as an attack because repeated service errors and high packet rates resemble denial-of-service activity.”

🔥 This is what makes your project XAI-driven, not just ML.

🔹 saved_models/

rf_model.pkl → Random Forest

if_model.pkl → Isolation Forest

Used directly during prediction (no retraining needed).

🔹 utils/
helpers.py

Role: Utility functions

Contains:

Data validation

JSON formatting

Logging helpers

Keeps other files clean and readable.

🔹 frontend/
index.html

Role: UI layout

Displays:

Prediction result

Risk score

Explanation text

styles.css

Role: UI styling

Clean dashboard layout for demo/examiner.

👉🏻dashboard.js

Role: Frontend logic

Sends traffic data to backend

Receives JSON response

Dynamically updates UI
